						<h3>Hosting a Website</h3>
						<p>
							Website hosting is a common thing to do, but sometimes you may
							want to expand your website’s functionality with more complex
							services like databases, analytics, machine learning, etc. Hosting
							your website on AWS is a great way to bridge this gap. Shown below
							are some of the most common ways of hosting a website.
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>Note</u>: Anything can be as simple or as complicated as you
							want it.

								Have your website ready to deploy, whether it be a React app,
								WordPress site, ASP.NET application, or plain old HTML, CSS, and
								JS.

							<img

							/>
							<p>
								Lightsail is the easiest way to deploy a website on AWS. Simply
								upload your code or pass a link to your Docker image repository.
								Lightsail will then provide you a link to access your public
								site online. The
								<a
									class="footer-link"

							<img
								class="img-fluid center-image website-image"
								src="assets/img/image 51.png"
							/>
							<p>
								Amplify is another easy way to deploy a website on AWS. Simply
								upload your code or pass a link to your GitHub repository
								containing your code. Amplify will then provide you a link to
								access your public site online. Amplify also makes it easy to
								extend your site’s functionality by combining with login, API,
								and database resources.

							<img

							<p>
								S3 is a basically like Google Drive where you can upload your
								static files to. This method is best suited for simple HTML,
								CSS, and JS files. Once you upload your files, S3 will provide
								you a link to access them publicly on the web. You can
								optionally add a content delivery network like Cloudfront in
								front of your URL for localized caching of web content. This
								simply reduces the number of direct calls to your S3 content
								because they are fetched from the Cloudfront cache instead.

							<h3>Elastic Beanstalk vs Elastic Container Service</h3>
							<h8 class="blueText">
								Elastic Beanstalk Difficulty: Semi Advanced
							</h8>
							<br />
							<h8 class="blueText">
								Elastic Container Service Difficulty: Advanced
							</h8>
							<img
								class="img-fluid center-image website-image"
								src="assets/img/image 53.png"
							/>
							<p>
								Deployment options 4 and 5 can be deployed using either Elastic
								Beanstalk or Elastic Container Service. The only difference
								between the two is that Elastic Beanstalk provides an easy to
								use interface for deploying an Elastic Container Service under
								the hood. Some options may also not be available if using
								Elastic Beanstalk. If you want to get fine grain control over
								your site’s architecture, use Elastic Container Service. Both
								services allow you to spin up one or more copies of your site
								across several servers. You provide a link to the Docker image
								of your website code and it’ll run a copy of it on each server.
								The amount of servers running can be be automatically scaled by
								an auto-scaling group which detects the amount of traffic to
								your site and compares it to the current CPU and memory from the
								servers available. If there’s too much traffic and not enough
								CPU or memory from the current servers, it’ll automatically spin
								up more servers to meet the demand. Lastly a load balancer will
								provide you a URL to visit your site and it will evenly
								distribute traffic across your servers.
							</p>

						<div class="website-box-hidden website-box shiftDown">
							<h3>Deployment option 4</h3>
							<h3 class="redText">Fargate</h3>
							<h8 class="blueText">Difficulty: Advanced</h8>
							<img
								class="img-fluid center-image website-image"
								src="assets/img/image 54.png"
							/>
							<p>
								Fargate allows you to deploy servers on the cloud without the
								hassle of managing them. This means they won’t show up as
								traditional EC2 servers nor will they officially show up in your
								account since they are actually managed by AWS. This makes
								deploying easier since management of servers are handled by AWS.
								You can only select a predefined server type and it will be used
								for running your website code.

							<h8 class="blueText">Difficulty: Advanced</h8>
							<img
								class="img-fluid center-image website-image"
								src="assets/img/image 55.png"
							/>
							<p>
								EC2 is the traditional way of deploying servers. These servers
								will show up under your account as they are managed by you. You
								have more control over the specifics of your servers such as the
								security permissions they have as well as the virtual cloud
								network they can be attached to. You also have more control over
								what software can be deployed onto the servers. It requires more
								management and maintenance though. You can still select a
								predefined server type and it will be used for running your
								website code.

						<div class="website-box-hidden website-box shiftDown">
							<h3>Deployment option 6</h3>
							<h3 class="redText">Elastic Kubernetes Service</h3>
							<h8 class="blueText">Difficulty: Hard</h8>
							<img
								class="img-fluid center-image website-image"
								src="assets/img/image 56.png"
							/>
							<p>
								Elastic Kubernetes Service is based on the popularily used open
								source Kubernetes service for container orchestration. It does
								the same thing as Elastic Beanstalk and Elastic Container
								Service except that AWS doesn’t provide you an interface for
								managing your servers, autoscaling group, etc. Instead you get a
								link to the Kubernetes Control Plane which is where you set up
								your architecture and adjust settings. So if you like using
								Kubernetes, you can migrate to this service fairly easily.

						<h3>API</h3>
						<p>
							The goal of an API is to serve data requested by the user. An user
							typically queries data with a given filter such as an id,

							been processed.

										The most common type of API is REST. You typically perform
										create, read, update, and delete operations which are POST,
										GET, PUT, and DELETE, respectively. You can use an API
										Gateway as an entry point to your API code. It’ll map out
										all the different paths and methods for you and you can
										either have one Lambda function for each path/method or one
										Lambda function to handle them all. The Lambda function will
										simply run your code, and so you choose what you want to do
										with the input request. API Gateway will provide you with a

							<p>
								RDS or relational database service is a solution for hosting
								database systems like MySQL, SQL Server, or PostgresSQL. You
								always store data in a relational format which means data from
								one table should relate to data in another table. The format of
								data in each column is very strict and the data you insert must
								adhere to the data formats that you specify. RDS is
								traditionally a server option which means you specify the number
								of servers you need and what type you need. However, there is
								currently a preview option for hosting MySQL RDS in serverless
								mode as of December 2022.

							<p>
								DynamoDB is an easy to use database for setting up relational or
								non-relational data. You typically store records in a table like
								format and each record can store an arbitrary amount of data in
								columnar format. You can relate data in different DynamoDB
								tables by storing id references in each record (e.g. book table
								has a column called owner which contains the id of a person in
								the person table). It is a serverless service which means you
								don’t manage any servers.

								MongoDB is one of the most popular software for storing data in

									Kinesis Data Streams is a way to pass data from one or more
									producers (generates data) to one or more consumers (processes
									data). Data can optionally be stored on a stream for up to a
									year before being discarded. Typically consumers will have to
									poll for the data. Each time you poll for data, you can either
									fetch the last record that was added, the first record that
									was added, or your last cursor position (this is the last
									record you looked at) and then go from there.

									Event Bridge is typically used for internal use between

									from a source to a destination is event driven, meaning that
									as a source generates data, it’ll trigger the pipeline and

									SQS or simple queue service simply send data from one source

									not ready to process the data yet or it can preserve data
									should the destination fail to process the data. Data will be
									stored on the pipeline until it expires after a set amount of
									days (means the destination did not process the message).
									Consumers will have to poll data off an SQS data pipeline in

								<h3>Steps</h3>
								<li>
									An user logs into the app and sends a request for private
									data.
								</li>
								<li>The app passes the user login credentials to Firebase.</li>
								<li>
									Firebase returns back a JWT token that can be used for
									authentication. This token contains some user metadata such as
									their user id.
								</li>
								<li>
									An HTTPS request is sent over the internet to API Gateway with
									Firebase token in authorization header.
								</li>
								<li>
									API Gateway passes the authorization token to the Lambda
									authorizer.
								</li>
								<li>
									The Lambda authorizer will validate the token against
									Firebase.
								</li>
								<li>
									Firebase returns a success or error message depending on
									whether the token was valid.
								</li>
								<li>
									The Lambda authorizer will notify API Gateway whether the
									authentication succeeded or failed.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the Lambda authorizer succeeded, then the API’s Lambda
									function will be invoked.
								</li>
								<li>
									The API code will handle the user’s request and return back
									the requested private data for the specific user.
								</li>
